.. _minhash_lsh:

MinHash LSH
===========

Suppose you have a very large collection of
`sets <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)>`__. Giving a
query, which is also a set, you want to find sets in your collection
that have Jaccard similarities above certain threshold, and you want to
do it with many other queries. To do this efficiently, you can create a
MinHash for every set, and when a query comes, you compute the Jaccard
similarities between the query MinHash and all the MinHash of your
collection, and return the sets that satisfy your threshold.

The said approach is still an O(n) algorithm, meaning the query cost
increases linearly with respect to the number of sets. A popular
alternative is to use Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) index. LSH can be
used with MinHash to achieve sub-linear query cost - that is a huge
improvement. The details of the algorithm can be found in `Chapter 3,
Mining of Massive
Datasets <http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/mmds/ch3.pdf>`__,

This package includes the classic version of MinHash LSH. It is
important to note that the query does not give you the exact result, due
to the use of MinHash and LSH. There will be false positives - sets that
do not satisfy your threshold but returned, and false negatives -
qualifying sets that are not returned. However, the property of LSH
assures that sets with higher Jaccard similarities always have higher
probabilities to get returned than sets with lower similarities.
Moreover, LSH can be optimized so that there can be a "jump" in
probability right at the threshold, making the qualifying sets much more
likely to get returned than the rest.

.. code:: python
        
        from datasketch import MinHash, MinHashLSH

        set1 = set(['minhash', 'is', 'a', 'probabilistic', 'data', 'structure', 'for',
                    'estimating', 'the', 'similarity', 'between', 'datasets'])
        set2 = set(['minhash', 'is', 'a', 'probability', 'data', 'structure', 'for',
                    'estimating', 'the', 'similarity', 'between', 'documents'])
        set3 = set(['minhash', 'is', 'probability', 'data', 'structure', 'for',
                    'estimating', 'the', 'similarity', 'between', 'documents'])
        
        m1 = MinHash(num_perm=128)
        m2 = MinHash(num_perm=128)
        m3 = MinHash(num_perm=128)
        for d in set1:
            m1.update(d.encode('utf8'))
        for d in set2:
            m2.update(d.encode('utf8'))
        for d in set3:
            m3.update(d.encode('utf8'))

        # Create LSH index
        lsh = MinHashLSH(threshold=0.5, num_perm=128)
        lsh.insert("m2", m2)
        lsh.insert("m3", m3)
        result = lsh.query(m1)
        print("Approximate neighbours with Jaccard similarity > 0.5", result)

The Jaccard similarity threshold must be set at initialization, and
cannot be changed. So does the number of permutation functions (``num_perm``) parameter. 
Similar to MinHash, more permutation functions improves the accuracy,
but also increases query cost, since more processing is required as the
MinHash gets bigger. 
I experimented with the `20 News Group
Dataset <http://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/twenty_newsgroups.html>`__,
which has an average cardinality of 193 (3-shingles). The average
recall, average precision, and 90 percentile query time vs. number of permutation 
functions
are plotted below. 
See the `benchmark` 
directory in the source code repository for more experiment and 
plotting code.

There are other optional parameters that can be used to tune the index.
See the documentation of :class:`datasketch.MinHashLSH` for details.

MinHash LSH does not support Top-K queries.
See :ref:`minhash_lsh_forest` for an alternative.
In addition, Jaccard similarity may not be the best measure if your intention is to
find sets having high intersection with the query.
For intersection search, see :ref:`minhash_lsh_ensemble`.

.. _minhash_lsh_at_scale:

MinHash LSH at scale
--------------------
MinHash LSH supports using Redis as the storage layer for handling large index and 
providing optional persistence as part of
a production environment. 
The Redis storage option can be configured using:

.. code:: python

      from datasketch import MinHashLSH

      lsh = MinHashLSH(
         threshold=0.5, num_perm=128, storage_config={
            'type': 'redis',
            'redis': {'host': 'localhost', 'port': 6379}
         })

To insert a large number of MinHashes in sequence, it is advisable to use
an insertion session. This reduces the number of network calls during
bulk insertion.

.. code:: python

      data_list = [("m1", m1), ("m2", m2), ("m3", m3)]

      with lsh.insertion_session() as session:
         for key, minhash in data_list:
            session.insert(key, minhash)

Note that querying the LSH object during an open insertion session may result in
inconsistency.

Connecting to Existing MinHash LSH
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are using an external storage layer (e.g., Redis) for your LSH, you can 
share it across multiple processes. Ther are two ways to do it:

The recommended way is to use "pickling". The MinHash LSH object is serializable
so you can call `pickle`:

.. code:: python

    import pickle

    # Create your LSH object
    lsh = ...
    # Serialize the LSH
    data = pickle.dumps(lsh)
    # Now you can pass it as an argument to a forked process or simply save it
    # in an external storage.

    # In a different process, deserialize the LSH
    lsh = pickle.loads(data)

Using pickle allows you to preserve everything you need to know about the LSH
such as various parameter settings in a single location.

Alternatively you can specify a unique `base_name` in the storage config when
you first creating the LSH. For example:

.. code:: python
    
    lsh = MinHashLSH(
     threshold=0.5, num_perm=128, storage_config={
        'type': 'redis',
        'base_name': 'unique_name_6ac4fg',
        'redis': {'host': 'localhost', 'port': 6379}
     })

The `base_name` will be used to generate key prefixes in the storage layer to
uniquely identify data associated with this LSH. Thus, if you create a new
LSH object with the same `base_name`, you will be using the same underlying
data in the storage layer associated with the old LSH.

.. _minhash_lsh_async:

Asynchronous MinHash LSH at scale
---------------------------------

.. note::
    The module supports Python version >=3.6, and is currently experimental. 
    So the interface may change slightly in the future.

This module may be useful if you want to process millions of text documents 
in streaming/batch mode using asynchronous RESTful API for clustering tasks, 
and you expecting to maximize the throughput of your service.
For example, this module allows your code to not get blocked by insertion. 

We currently provide two implementations:

* Asynchronous Redis storage (*python aioredis package*)
* Asynchronous MongoDB storage (*python motor package*)

Experimental result

* Number of objects (insert, query): 12500
* Pool: `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=100)`
* check_duplication: false
* buffer_size: 500

In summary, for faster querying use AsyncMinHashLSH module, 
and for faster insertion consider use MinHashLSH module.

If you consider using MongoDB storage, the asynchronous 
implementation is faster then synchronous MongoDB 
(*python pymongo package*). Though, it's slower than Redis storage.

For sharing across different Python
processes see :ref:`minhash_lsh_at_scale`.

The Asynchronous Redis storage option can be configured using:

* Usual way:

.. code:: python

        from datasketch.experimental.async import AsyncMinHashLSH

        _storage = {'type': 'aioredis', 'redis': {'host': 'localhost', 'port': 6379}}

        lsh = await AsyncMinHashLSH(storage_config=_storage, threshold=0.5, num_perm=16)
        m1 = MinHash(16)
        m1.update('a'.encode('utf8'))
        m2 = MinHash(16)
        m2.update('b'.encode('utf8'))
        await lsh.insert('a', m1)
        await lsh.insert('b', m2)
        print(await lsh.query(m1))
        print(await lsh.query(m2))
        lsh.close()

* Context Manager style:

.. code:: python

        from datasketch.experimental.async import AsyncMinHashLSH

        _storage = {'type': 'aioredis', 'redis': {'host': 'localhost', 'port': 6379}}

        async with AsyncMinHashLSH(storage_config=_storage, threshold=0.5, num_perm=16) as lsh:
            m1 = MinHash(16)
            m1.update('a'.encode('utf8'))
            m2 = MinHash(16)
            m2.update('b'.encode('utf8'))
            await lsh.insert('a', m1)
            await lsh.insert('b', m2)
            print(await lsh.query(m1))
            print(await lsh.query(m2))

To configure Asynchronous MongoDB storage, use:

.. code:: python

        _storage = {'type': 'aiomongo', 'mongo': {'host': 'localhost', 'port': 27017, 'db': 'lsh_test'}}
        
To index a large number of MinHashes using asynchronous MinHash LSH.

.. code:: python

    from datasketch.experimental.async import AsyncMinHashLSH

    def chunk(it, size):
        it = iter(it)
        return iter(lambda: tuple(islice(it, size)), ())

    _chunked_str = chunk((random.choice(string.ascii_lowercase) for _ in range(10000)), 4)
    seq = frozenset(chain((''.join(s) for s in _chunked_str), ('aahhb', 'aahh', 'aahhc', 'aac', 'kld', 'bhg', 'kkd', 'yow', 'ppi', 'eer')))
    objs = [MinHash(16) for _ in range(len(seq))]
    for e, obj in zip(seq, objs):
        for i in e:
            obj.update(i.encode('utf-8'))
    data = [(e, m) for e, m in zip(seq, objs)]

    _storage = {'type': 'aiomongo', 'mongo': {'host': 'localhost', 'port': 27017, 'db': 'lsh_test'}}
    async with AsyncMinHashLSH(storage_config=_storage, threshold=0.5, num_perm=16) as lsh:
        async with lsh.insertion_session(batch_size=1000) as session:
            fs = (session.insert(key, minhash, check_duplication=False) for key, minhash in data)
            await asyncio.gather(*fs)
