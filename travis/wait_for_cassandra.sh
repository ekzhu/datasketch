    # The easiest way to wait for Cassandra would be to use:
    #   cqlsh -e "describe cluster;"
    # However, since Cassandra is installed as a deb package, it means that the provided python
    # modules which are used by the command line tool 'cqlsh' are installed inside 'dist-packages'.
    # 'cqlsh' is a wrapper that might pick up a python interpreter that does not load packages
    # from that directory, so we could update the PYTHONPATH environmental variable here just for
    # this script. However doing this would risk mixing modules of different python versions
    # together, with potentially unpredictable effects (though limited to this script).
    #
    # To preserve our future mental sanity we run a small python program that does not depend
    # on libraries installed by cassandra, but just packages we already installed (the driver).
